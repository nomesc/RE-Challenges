The NAME must be 5 characters or longer.  
The PASS is generated by wsprintfA(PASS,"RS-%ld-%lu",var_8)  
var_8 depends on the name of the user running the program and the length of the name and the NAME entered and its length  
By the time I discovered how var_8 is calculated I've observed that wsprintfA needs two arguments (%ld %lu) but it only gets one, var_8  
Therfore the resulting string is not predictible since we don't know whats on the stack?(I don't)  
Sadly I had to patch the executable so that LPCSTR is "RS-%ld".
